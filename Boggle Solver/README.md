<h5>The Boggle Game</h5>
<p>Boggle is a word game designed by Allan Turoff and distributed by Hasbro. It involves a board made up of 16 cubic dice, where each die has a letter printed on each of its 6 sides. At the beginning of the game, the 16 dice are shaken and randomly distributed into a 4-by-4 tray, with only the top sides of the dice visible. The players compete to accumulate points by building valid words from the dice, according to these rules: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A valid word must be composed by following a sequence of adjacent diceâ€”two dice are adjacent if they are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbors. </li>
  <li>A valid word can use each die at most once. </li>
  <li>A valid word must contain at least 3 letters. </li>
  <li>A valid word must be in the dictionary (which typically does not contain proper nouns).</li>
  </ul>
  A valid example is given below:</br>
