<h3>QUEUES</h3>

<h5>This contains generic data type implementation for a deque and a randomized queue.</h5></br>

<b>Dequeue</b>: A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the
front or the back of the data structure.</br>
<b>RandomizedQueue</b>:A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data 
structure.</br>
Client program: Permutation.java that takes an integer k as a command-line argument; reads a sequence of strings from standard input and prints exactly k of them,
uniformly at random.</br>
Example of the command line argument: java Permutation.java 5 <test.txt
